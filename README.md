**#Simple Calculator in Python**

This Python script implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input two numbers and select the desired operation to obtain the result.

Key Features:

User Interface: The calculator provides a user-friendly interface with a menu displaying the available arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

Input Validation: The script includes input validation to ensure that users enter numerical values for calculations. If non-numeric inputs are provided, appropriate error messages are displayed.

Arithmetic Operations: Each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate function (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to facilitate code organization and readability.

Continuous Usage: The calculator allows users to perform multiple calculations in a loop. After completing each calculation, users are prompted to continue or exit the calculator.

Usage:

Select Operation: Choose the desired arithmetic operation from the menu by entering the corresponding number (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, and 4 for division).

Enter Numbers: Input two numbers when prompted. If non-numeric inputs are provided, an error message will be displayed, and users will be prompted to enter valid numbers.

View Result: The calculator displays the result of the selected operation along with the input numbers.

Continue or Exit: After viewing the result, users have the option to continue using the calculator for additional calculations or exit the program.

Contributing:

Contributions to the Simple Calculator project are welcome! Whether it's adding new features, improving input validation, or enhancing error handling, your contributions can help make the calculator more robust and user-friendly.
